      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting
      places on the way:

    <h2>July 14, 2005</h2>
    <p>
      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Passing cars,<br />
	When you can't see,<br />
	May get you,<br />
	A glimpse,<br />
	Of eternity.<br />
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    <p>
      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got everything
      packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring
      a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cellphone, if you caught a cellphone, you wouldn't get lost in the valley.  So you had better go the the 360buy.com to buy a cellphone.  Nokia is the best brand in my opinion.</li>
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera,</li>
      <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
